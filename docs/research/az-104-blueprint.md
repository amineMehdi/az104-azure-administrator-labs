# AZ-104 blueprint research baseline

Research date: **2026-08-30**
Skills measured from: **2026-04-17**
Primary authority: [Microsoft's AZ-104 study guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/az-104)

## Research result

The current English-language study guide defines five weighted skill domains, 15 skill groups, and 82 objective bullets. `curriculum/blueprint.yml` is the machine-readable source of truth for this repository; `docs/objective-map.md` is its learner-readable lab mapping.

Microsoft notes that the bullets illustrate how each skill is assessed, related topics may also appear, and most questions cover generally available features. Preview features may appear when commonly used. The repository therefore treats these objectives as a minimum coverage boundary rather than a promise about the exact contents or distribution of exam questions.

## Skills at a glance

| Domain ID | Official skill domain | Weight | Groups | Objectives | Primary labs |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `IG` | Manage Azure identities and governance | 20–25% | 3 | 15 | 01–05, 26–27 |
| `ST` | Implement and manage storage | 15–20% | 3 | 17 | 06–09, 26 |
| `CP` | Deploy and manage Azure compute resources | 20–25% | 4 | 24 | 10–16, 26 |
| `NW` | Implement and manage virtual networking | 15–20% | 3 | 13 | 17–21, 26–27 |
| `MR` | Monitor and maintain Azure resources | 10–15% | 2 | 13 | 21–27 |
| **Total** |  |  | **15** | **82** | **28 labs including Lab 00** |

Weights are ranges published by Microsoft. They must not be converted into an assumed question count.

## Stable objective IDs

Microsoft publishes objective text but not repository-safe identifiers. This project assigns IDs in `DOMAIN-GROUP-NN` form:

- `IG`, `ST`, `CP`, `NW`, and `MR` identify the five official domains.
- The middle segment identifies the official skill group, such as `USERS`, `IAC`, or `SECURE`.
- The two-digit suffix follows the objective order in the 2026-04-17 English study guide.

These IDs remain stable within this blueprint version. If Microsoft changes an objective, a future research pass must record the change rather than silently reusing an ID for unrelated text.

Lab 00 also has five `FD-*` foundation outcomes for tools, Azure context, cost gating, safe state handling, and cleanup. They are deliberately stored outside `domains` and are **not** included in the official count of 82.

## Curriculum interpretation

- Azure CLI or PowerShell is the canonical execution surface for each lab. Graph/Entra PowerShell, Bicep, AzCopy, KQL, and Portal inspection are used where an objective requires them.
- The official containers group retains the words “in the Azure portal.” This curriculum still implements and validates the objectives through Azure CLI or PowerShell so the lab workflow remains reproducible and command-first.
- Some tenant-wide, licensed, paid, quota-sensitive, or long-running objectives need a gated or partial path. Their objective remains mapped even when live execution requires separate authorization.
- Capstone mappings reinforce earlier teaching; they do not replace the primary instructional lab for an objective.
- The objective map covers every official bullet at least once. Lab metadata and assessment questions will reference the same IDs so coverage can be tested automatically.

## Change-control procedure

Before a release or whenever Microsoft announces an exam update:

1. Reopen the English study guide and certification page.
2. Confirm the effective date, five weights, group headings, and every objective bullet.
3. Compare the new text against `curriculum/blueprint.yml`.
4. Update the source register and research date.
5. Re-run exact counts, uniqueness checks, lab coverage checks, and assessment coverage checks.
6. Document additions, removals, renames, or reordered objectives in the release notes.

## Research boundaries

The blueprint is not an exam dump, prediction model, or substitute for Microsoft's current study guide. Lab scenarios and assessment questions must be original. Official documentation supports technical claims and answer rationales, while the study guide alone controls which bullets count as official AZ-104 objectives for this baseline.
