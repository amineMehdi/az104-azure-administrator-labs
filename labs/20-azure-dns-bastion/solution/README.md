# Lab 20 solution and diagnostic notes

Use this only after completing the guided lab. In Labs 01–25, complete the knowledge check before reading these notes. The solution is evidence-led: it does not replace the independent validator or silently repair live state.

## Intended checkpoint sequence

1. **Checkpoint 1:** Create a correctly named and sized AzureBastionSubnet with a Standard static public IP.
2. **Checkpoint 2:** Deploy Azure Bastion and inspect SKU, scale units, and supported native-client features.
3. **Checkpoint 3:** Create an isolated Azure DNS public zone and A/CNAME/TXT records using a lab-owned label.
4. **Checkpoint 4:** Verify authoritative name servers and perform external delegation only for AZ104_OWNED_DNS_ZONE.
5. **Checkpoint 5:** Correlate service state with the run manifest, retain redacted validation evidence, and prove cleanup readiness.

## Diagnostic order

1. Confirm that the active tenant and subscription match `.state/<run-id>/run.json`.
2. Confirm the exact resource group or tenant object ID; do not select by a name prefix.
3. Inspect provider registration, service quota, region support, and asynchronous provisioning state.
4. Compare the live configuration with the checkpoint statement in [the lab guide](../README.md).
5. Read `.state/<run-id>/validation.json` and reproduce the failing read-only query directly.
6. Repair only the smallest identified mismatch, then rerun validation.
7. If a prerequisite is absent, record `skipped` or `warning`; never convert a gate into a false pass.

## Expected reasoning

Bastion provides managed administrative connectivity without VM public IPs, while Azure DNS becomes authoritative only after the parent domain delegates to its assigned name servers.

The permission boundary is: Network Contributor; DNS Zone Contributor for an owned zone

The live gate is: Real public DNS delegation requires AZ104_OWNED_DNS_ZONE and control of the parent registrar; the isolated zone path is always available.

## Common failure classes

- **Context mismatch:** select the intended context yourself and rerun preflight. The scripts intentionally do not sign in or switch it.
- **Authorization failure:** inspect the failed action and required scope. Do not broaden to subscription or tenant scope without a justified objective.
- **Provider, quota, SKU, or region failure:** use the preflight evidence and choose an approved supported region/SKU; document any fallback.
- **Eventual consistency:** poll the documented operation state and retain timestamps. Do not interpret a transient empty query as final success.
- **Network or DNS failure:** inspect effective routes/rules, name resolution, private DNS links, listener/probe state, and the guest firewall/application separately.
- **Cleanup dependency:** remove recorded locks, role/policy assignments, protection or replication state, private links, and retained data in the service's required order.

## Completion evidence

A defensible result includes a run manifest, independent validation report, redacted Azure CLI evidence captured from PowerShell, and a cleanup/residual audit. Offline repository tests alone do not establish live verification.
