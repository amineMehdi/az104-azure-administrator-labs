# Lab 22: Collect and analyze Azure Monitor metrics, logs, and Insights

[Previous: Lab 21](../21-load-balancer-network-watcher/README.md) · [Catalog](../README.md) · [Next: Lab 23](../23-monitor-alerts-actions/README.md)

This self-contained lab uses Azure CLI commands hosted in PowerShell. Complete the guided lane or the automated lane—not both with the same run ID.

## Scenario, role, and outcome

Scenario: You are a monitoring administrator building an evidence-based service view. Build and prove this disposable service path: A storage transaction enters Azure Monitor through the account diagnostic setting, routes to the run-owned Log Analytics workspace, and is located by a bounded KQL assertion against the exact storage resource ID.

Learner role: A monitoring administrator building an evidence-based service view.

Outcome: Use Azure CLI in PowerShell to create the monitored storage account and workspace, route resource metrics into log analytics, and reconcile diagnostic configuration and ingested telemetry, with recoverable state and deterministic cleanup.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Duration | 135 minutes |
| Difficulty | applied |
| Cost class | `moderate` |
| Command surface | Azure CLI (`az`, `az rest`, Bicep, AzCopy, or KQL where required) hosted in PowerShell |
| Live state | Not executed during this offline rebuild |

Completion criteria:

- All required checkpoints report pass.
- The deterministic break/fix is injected, diagnosed, and repaired.
- cleanup.json reports no active run-owned resources, with any retained item explicitly documented.

## Objectives and checkpoints

| Objective | Skill | Checkpoints |
|---|---|---|
| `MR-MONITOR-01` | Interpret metrics in Azure Monitor | `LAB22-CP01`, `LAB22-CP05` |
| `MR-MONITOR-02` | Configure log settings in Azure Monitor | `LAB22-CP02`, `LAB22-CP05` |
| `MR-MONITOR-03` | Query and analyze logs in Azure Monitor | `LAB22-CP03`, `LAB22-CP05` |
| `MR-MONITOR-05` | Configure and interpret monitoring of virtual machines, storage accounts, and networks by using Azure Monitor Insights | `LAB22-CP04`, `LAB22-CP05` |
| `MR-MONITOR-06` | Use Azure Network Watcher and Connection monitor | `LAB22-CP05` |

The authoritative objective wording comes from the [Microsoft AZ-104 study guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/az-104), skills measured as of 2026-04-17.

## Architecture and service topology

![Lab 22 service topology](diagrams/architecture.svg)

The editable source is [architecture.mmd](diagrams/architecture.mmd). A storage transaction enters Azure Monitor through the account diagnostic setting, routes to the run-owned Log Analytics workspace, and is located by a bounded KQL assertion against the exact storage resource ID.

## Concept primer and design decisions

Platform metrics are numeric time series; resource logs require diagnostic settings; Log Analytics stores queryable tables; Insights layers curated workbooks and dependencies over those signals. Ingestion latency must be handled explicitly.

Design decisions:

- Discover supported diagnostic categories before configuring them.
- Use bounded workspace retention.
- Treat an empty fresh KQL result as pending evidence, not automatic failure.

## Required and optional inputs

| Input | Required | Source | Safe example | Gate behavior |
|---|:---:|---|---|---|
| `run-id` — Unique lowercase run ownership identifier | Yes | parameter | `az104l22-01` | `block` |
| `subscription-id` — Expected disposable subscription ID | Yes | parameter-or-environment (`AZ104_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`) | `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` | `block` |
| `location` — Approved primary Azure region | Yes | parameter-or-environment (`AZ104_LOCATION`) | `westeurope` | `block` |

Secrets stay in temporary environment variables and are never written to `run.json`, validation evidence, or Git. A `skip-checkpoint` gate produces a visible partial result; it never becomes a pass.

## Read-only preflight

Sign in deliberately, inspect the active context, then run the lab preflight. It never signs in, changes context, installs an extension, registers a provider, or creates a resource.

```powershell
az login
az account show --query '{cloud:environmentName,subscription:id,tenant:tenantId,user:user.name}' --output json
./scripts/cli/Preflight.ps1 -SubscriptionId $env:AZ104_SUBSCRIPTION_ID -RunId 'az104l22-01' -Location 'westeurope'
```

Representative redacted output:

```text
context                 True  cloud=AzureCloud; tenant=<redacted>; subscription=<redacted>
azure-cli               True  2.88.x
provider:<namespace>    True  Registered
region                  True  westeurope
Preflight passed. It performed no Azure mutation.
```

If a required row fails, stop. Correct the local tool, context, provider, quota, SKU, region, permission, or input outside the lab, then rerun preflight.

## Task 1 — Verify Log Analytics, diagnostic, and KQL prerequisites {#task-1}

Checkpoint: `LAB22-CP01`

Purpose and operational relevance: Read the provider, region, SKU, feature, quota, and companion-tool signals needed for verify log analytics, diagnostic, and kql prerequisites, without changing Azure state. The change is unsafe when a diagnostic setting cannot select a category the target resource does not advertise. This checkpoint therefore proves: The workspace and diagnostic-setting APIs are available and the planned resource exposes a metric category that can be collected.

Run these commands from PowerShell. If you already used the automated lane, choose a new run ID before trying this guided lane.

```powershell
az provider show --namespace Microsoft.Insights --query registrationState --output tsv
az provider show --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights --query registrationState --output tsv
az provider show --namespace Microsoft.Storage --query registrationState --output tsv
```

Expected state: The workspace and diagnostic-setting APIs are available and the planned resource exposes a metric category that can be collected.

Representative redacted output:

```text
The workspace and diagnostic-setting APIs are available and the planned resource exposes a metric category that can be collected.
```

Positive validation:

```powershell
$insights = az provider show --namespace Microsoft.Insights --query registrationState --output tsv
if ($insights -ne 'Registered') { throw 'Microsoft.Insights is not registered.' }
```

Expected positive result: The workspace and diagnostic-setting APIs are available and the planned resource exposes a metric category that can be collected.

Negative validation:

```powershell
$logs = az provider show --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights --query registrationState --output tsv
if ($logs -ne 'Registered') { throw 'Microsoft.OperationalInsights is not registered.' }
```

Expected negative result: LAB22-CP01 negative boundary: The undesired state is absent; the negative assertion must not report: Microsoft.OperationalInsights is not registered.

Evidence to retain:

- LAB22-CP01 UTC result for verify log analytics, diagnostic, and kql prerequisites.
- Exact run-owned resource/object ID returned by the commands in LAB22-CP01.
- Positive assertion proving: The workspace and diagnostic-setting APIs are available and the planned resource exposes a metric category that can be collected.
- Negative assertion proving absence of: Microsoft.OperationalInsights is not registered.

Common failure and safe retry: A diagnostic setting cannot select a category the target resource does not advertise. Retry LAB22-CP01 for verify log analytics, diagnostic, and kql prerequisites only after its exact recorded ID and current property are read. If the ID exists, reissue only the idempotent update; if it is absent, repeat only the owning create command, then rerun both assertions.

Cleanup dependency: After LAB22-CP02, LAB22-CP03, LAB22-CP04, LAB22-CP05, remove the exact manifest IDs created or configured by LAB22-CP01 for verify log analytics, diagnostic, and kql prerequisites; its residual probe must then return zero active IDs.

## Task 2 — Create the monitored storage account and workspace {#task-2}

Checkpoint: `LAB22-CP02`

Purpose and operational relevance: Provision and immediately inventory the exact run-owned resources needed to create the monitored storage account and workspace, so partial completion remains recoverable. The change is unsafe when a workspace can provision successfully while its customer ID or resource ID is read from the wrong group. This checkpoint therefore proves: The storage account and Log Analytics workspace IDs are immediately recorded in the run manifest.

Run these commands from PowerShell. If you already used the automated lane, choose a new run ID before trying this guided lane.

```powershell
$workspace = "law-$suffix"; $storage = "st22$suffix"
az monitor log-analytics workspace create --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --workspace-name $workspace --location $Location --retention-time 30 --output none
az storage account create --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --name $storage --location $Location --sku Standard_LRS --kind StorageV2 --https-only true --allow-blob-public-access false --output none
$workspaceResourceId = az monitor log-analytics workspace show --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --workspace-name $workspace --query id --output tsv
$workspaceId = az monitor log-analytics workspace show --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --workspace-name $workspace --query customerId --output tsv
$storageId = az storage account show --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --name $storage --query id --output tsv
$metricCategory = az monitor diagnostic-settings categories list --resource $storageId --query "value[?categoryType=='Metrics'].name | [0]" --output tsv
$metrics = @(@{ category = $metricCategory; enabled = $true }) | ConvertTo-Json -Compress
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name "diag-$RunId" --resource $storageId --workspace $workspaceResourceId --metrics $metrics --output none
```

Expected state: The storage account and Log Analytics workspace IDs are immediately recorded in the run manifest.

Representative redacted output:

```text
The storage account and Log Analytics workspace IDs are immediately recorded in the run manifest.
```

Positive validation:

```powershell
$destination = az monitor diagnostic-settings show --name "diag-$RunId" --resource $storageId --query workspaceId --output tsv
if ($destination -ne $workspaceResourceId) { throw 'The diagnostic setting points to the wrong workspace.' }
```

Expected positive result: The storage account and Log Analytics workspace IDs are immediately recorded in the run manifest.

Negative validation:

```powershell
$settingCount = az monitor diagnostic-settings list --resource $storageId --query "value[?name=='diag-$RunId'] | length(@)" --output tsv
if ([int]$settingCount -ne 1) { throw "Expected one diagnostic setting; found $settingCount." }
```

Expected negative result: LAB22-CP02 negative boundary: The undesired state is absent; the negative assertion must not report: Expected one diagnostic setting; found reported settingCount.

Evidence to retain:

- LAB22-CP02 UTC result for create the monitored storage account and workspace.
- Exact run-owned resource/object ID returned by the commands in LAB22-CP02.
- Positive assertion proving: The storage account and Log Analytics workspace IDs are immediately recorded in the run manifest.
- Negative assertion proving absence of: Expected one diagnostic setting; found reported settingCount.

Common failure and safe retry: A workspace can provision successfully while its customer ID or resource ID is read from the wrong group. Retry LAB22-CP02 for create the monitored storage account and workspace only after its exact recorded ID and current property are read. If the ID exists, reissue only the idempotent update; if it is absent, repeat only the owning create command, then rerun both assertions.

Cleanup dependency: After LAB22-CP03, LAB22-CP04, LAB22-CP05, remove the exact manifest IDs created or configured by LAB22-CP02 for create the monitored storage account and workspace; its residual probe must then return zero active IDs.

## Task 3 — Route resource metrics into Log Analytics {#task-3}

Checkpoint: `LAB22-CP03`

Purpose and operational relevance: Configure and independently inspect the control-plane and data-path properties needed to route resource metrics into log analytics. The change is unsafe when diagnostic settings fail when the destination ID or metric category uses a display name instead of its API value. This checkpoint therefore proves: The diagnostic setting targets the run-owned workspace and enables the supported metrics category for the storage resource.

Run these commands from PowerShell. If you already used the automated lane, choose a new run ID before trying this guided lane.

```powershell
az monitor diagnostic-settings categories list --resource $storageId --query "value[].{name:name,type:categoryType}" --output table
$previousStorageKey = $env:AZURE_STORAGE_KEY
try {
    $env:AZURE_STORAGE_KEY = az storage account keys list --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --account-name $storage --query "[0].value" --output tsv
    az storage container create --account-name $storage --name telemetry --auth-mode key --output none
    az storage blob list --account-name $storage --container-name telemetry --auth-mode key --output none
} finally {
    if ($null -eq $previousStorageKey) { Remove-Item Env:AZURE_STORAGE_KEY -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue } else { $env:AZURE_STORAGE_KEY = $previousStorageKey }
    Remove-Variable previousStorageKey -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
}
az monitor metrics list --resource $storageId --metric Transactions --interval PT1H --output json
```

Expected state: The diagnostic setting targets the run-owned workspace and enables the supported metrics category for the storage resource.

Representative redacted output:

```text
The diagnostic setting targets the run-owned workspace and enables the supported metrics category for the storage resource.
```

Positive validation:

```powershell
$metricNames = az monitor metrics list-definitions --resource $storageId --query "value[?name.value=='Transactions'] | length(@)" --output tsv
if ([int]$metricNames -ne 1) { throw 'The Transactions metric definition is unavailable.' }
```

Expected positive result: The diagnostic setting targets the run-owned workspace and enables the supported metrics category for the storage resource.

Negative validation:

```powershell
$workspaceState = az monitor log-analytics workspace show --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --workspace-name $workspace --query provisioningState --output tsv
if ($workspaceState -ne 'Succeeded') { throw "Workspace state is $workspaceState." }
```

Expected negative result: LAB22-CP03 negative boundary: The undesired state is absent; the negative assertion must not report: Workspace state is reported workspaceState.

Evidence to retain:

- LAB22-CP03 UTC result for route resource metrics into log analytics.
- Exact run-owned resource/object ID returned by the commands in LAB22-CP03.
- Positive assertion proving: The diagnostic setting targets the run-owned workspace and enables the supported metrics category for the storage resource.
- Negative assertion proving absence of: Workspace state is reported workspaceState.

Common failure and safe retry: Diagnostic settings fail when the destination ID or metric category uses a display name instead of its API value. Retry LAB22-CP03 for route resource metrics into log analytics only after its exact recorded ID and current property are read. If the ID exists, reissue only the idempotent update; if it is absent, repeat only the owning create command, then rerun both assertions.

Cleanup dependency: After LAB22-CP04, LAB22-CP05, remove the exact manifest IDs created or configured by LAB22-CP03 for route resource metrics into log analytics; its residual probe must then return zero active IDs.

## Task 4 — Generate a transaction and prove KQL ingestion {#task-4}

Checkpoint: `LAB22-CP04`

Purpose and operational relevance: Exercise the deterministic operational or denied path needed to generate a transaction and prove kql ingestion, then retain comparable before-and-after results. The change is unsafe when log ingestion is asynchronous; an immediate successful query with zero rows is not proof of collection. This checkpoint therefore proves: A harmless storage data-plane operation is followed by a bounded query that finds at least one matching AzureMetrics row for the exact resource ID.

Run these commands from PowerShell. If you already used the automated lane, choose a new run ID before trying this guided lane.

```powershell
$deadline = (Get-Date).AddMinutes(15)
do {
    $metricRows = az monitor log-analytics query --workspace $workspaceId --analytics-query "AzureMetrics | where TimeGenerated > ago(30m) | where ResourceId =~ '$storageId' | where MetricName == 'Transactions' | summarize Rows=count()" --query "tables[0].rows[0][0]" --output tsv
    if (-not $metricRows -or [int]$metricRows -lt 1) { Start-Sleep -Seconds 30 }
} until (($metricRows -and [int]$metricRows -ge 1) -or (Get-Date) -gt $deadline)
if (-not $metricRows -or [int]$metricRows -lt 1) { throw 'No run-owned storage transaction reached AzureMetrics within the 15-minute bounded wait.' }
az monitor log-analytics query --workspace $workspaceId --analytics-query "AzureMetrics | where TimeGenerated > ago(30m) | where ResourceId =~ '$storageId' | where MetricName == 'Transactions' | project TimeGenerated, MetricName, Total, Count | take 20" --timespan PT30M --output table
```

Expected state: A harmless storage data-plane operation is followed by a bounded query that finds at least one matching AzureMetrics row for the exact resource ID.

Representative redacted output:

```text
A harmless storage data-plane operation is followed by a bounded query that finds at least one matching AzureMetrics row for the exact resource ID.
```

Positive validation:

```powershell
$metricRows = az monitor log-analytics query --workspace $workspaceId --analytics-query "AzureMetrics | where TimeGenerated > ago(30m) | where ResourceId =~ '$storageId' | where MetricName == 'Transactions' | summarize Rows=count()" --query "tables[0].rows[0][0]" --output tsv
if (-not $metricRows -or [int]$metricRows -lt 1) { throw 'AzureMetrics contains no transaction row for the run-owned storage account.' }
```

Expected positive result: A harmless storage data-plane operation is followed by a bounded query that finds at least one matching AzureMetrics row for the exact resource ID.

Negative validation:

```powershell
$disabledMetrics = az monitor diagnostic-settings show --name "diag-$RunId" --resource $storageId --query 'metrics[?enabled==`false`] | length(@)' --output tsv
if ([int]$disabledMetrics -ne 0) { throw 'A configured diagnostic metric category is disabled.' }
```

Expected negative result: LAB22-CP04 negative boundary: The undesired state is absent; the negative assertion must not report: A configured diagnostic metric category is disabled.

Evidence to retain:

- LAB22-CP04 UTC result for generate a transaction and prove kql ingestion.
- Exact run-owned resource/object ID returned by the commands in LAB22-CP04.
- Positive assertion proving: A harmless storage data-plane operation is followed by a bounded query that finds at least one matching AzureMetrics row for the exact resource ID.
- Negative assertion proving absence of: A configured diagnostic metric category is disabled.

Common failure and safe retry: Log ingestion is asynchronous; an immediate successful query with zero rows is not proof of collection. Retry LAB22-CP04 for generate a transaction and prove kql ingestion only after its exact recorded ID and current property are read. If the ID exists, reissue only the idempotent update; if it is absent, repeat only the owning create command, then rerun both assertions.

Cleanup dependency: After LAB22-CP05, remove the exact manifest IDs created or configured by LAB22-CP04 for generate a transaction and prove kql ingestion; its residual probe must then return zero active IDs.

## Task 5 — Reconcile diagnostic configuration and ingested telemetry {#task-5}

Checkpoint: `LAB22-CP05`

Purpose and operational relevance: Reconcile live service properties, returned IDs, and dependency-aware removal needed to reconcile diagnostic configuration and ingested telemetry before handoff. The change is unsafe when a query exit code of zero can hide an empty result unless the returned row count is asserted. This checkpoint therefore proves: The destination workspace ID, enabled category, deterministic transaction, and asserted KQL result form one traceable monitoring path.

Run these commands from PowerShell. If you already used the automated lane, choose a new run ID before trying this guided lane.

```powershell
az monitor diagnostic-settings show --name "diag-$RunId" --resource $storageId --query "{workspace:workspaceId,metrics:metrics[].{category:category,enabled:enabled}}" --output json
```

Expected state: The destination workspace ID, enabled category, deterministic transaction, and asserted KQL result form one traceable monitoring path.

Representative redacted output:

```text
The destination workspace ID, enabled category, deterministic transaction, and asserted KQL result form one traceable monitoring path.
```

Positive validation:

```powershell
$metric = az monitor metrics list --resource $storageId --metric Transactions --interval PT1H --query "value[0].name.value" --output tsv
if ($metric -ne 'Transactions') { throw "Unexpected metric response: $metric" }
```

Expected positive result: The destination workspace ID, enabled category, deterministic transaction, and asserted KQL result form one traceable monitoring path.

Negative validation:

```powershell
$wrongDestination = az monitor diagnostic-settings show --name "diag-$RunId" --resource $storageId --query workspaceId --output tsv
if ($wrongDestination -ne $workspaceResourceId) { throw 'Diagnostic data is routed to an unexpected workspace.' }
```

Expected negative result: LAB22-CP05 negative boundary: The undesired state is absent; the negative assertion must not report: Diagnostic data is routed to an unexpected workspace.

Evidence to retain:

- LAB22-CP05 UTC result for reconcile diagnostic configuration and ingested telemetry.
- Exact run-owned resource/object ID returned by the commands in LAB22-CP05.
- Positive assertion proving: The destination workspace ID, enabled category, deterministic transaction, and asserted KQL result form one traceable monitoring path.
- Negative assertion proving absence of: Diagnostic data is routed to an unexpected workspace.

Common failure and safe retry: A query exit code of zero can hide an empty result unless the returned row count is asserted. Retry LAB22-CP05 for reconcile diagnostic configuration and ingested telemetry only after its exact recorded ID and current property are read. If the ID exists, reissue only the idempotent update; if it is absent, repeat only the owning create command, then rerun both assertions.

Cleanup dependency: After all service validation and evidence capture, remove the exact manifest IDs created or configured by LAB22-CP05 for reconcile diagnostic configuration and ingested telemetry; its residual probe must then return zero active IDs.

## Final validation and result interpretation

Run independent deployment validation after all required checkpoints:

```powershell
./scripts/cli/Validate.ps1 -RunId 'az104l22-01' -Mode Deployment
az resource list --resource-group 'rg-az104-l22-az104l22-01' --query '[].{name:name,type:type}' --output table
```

- `pass`: every required positive and negative check passed.
- `partial`: every required check passed, but at least one optional gate was deliberately skipped.
- `fail`: a required checkpoint failed; do not record the lab as complete.

Keep the redacted `validation.json`; do not retain credentials, tokens, access keys, certificate material, email addresses, tenant IDs, or unredacted command output.

## Deterministic break/fix exercise

Injection: Delete the diagnostic setting while retaining the workspace and source resource.

Inject the bounded fault:

```powershell
az monitor diagnostic-settings delete --name "diag-$RunId" --resource $storageId
```

Capture the failed state with a read-only query:

```powershell
az monitor diagnostic-settings list --resource $storageId --output table
```

Repair only the injected setting, then repeat the same query:

```powershell
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name "diag-$RunId" --resource $storageId --workspace $workspaceResourceId --metrics $metrics --output none
az monitor diagnostic-settings show --name "diag-$RunId" --resource $storageId --query workspaceId --output tsv
```

Expected symptom: New source metrics stop being exported to the workspace.

Diagnose with a read-only service query:

```powershell
az monitor diagnostic-settings list --resource $storageId --output table
```

Diagnosis: List source diagnostic settings and run a time-bounded AzureMetrics query.

Repair: Recreate the setting with the recorded workspace resource ID and metric category.

Before/after evidence must show the failed negative or positive check before repair and the same check passing afterward. Do not inject a second fault until the first is removed.

## Optional job-style challenge

Create an operator query pack for failures, latency, volume, and recent administrative changes.

Deliver a short change record containing assumptions, exact commands, redacted evidence, cost and risk notes, rollback, and residual results. The challenge is optional and never changes required checkpoint status.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Safe next step |
|---|---|---|
| Context mismatch | Active CLI context differs from `run.json` | Stop, inspect `az account show`, and select the intended disposable context yourself. |
| Provider or feature unavailable | Registration, region, feature, or SKU gate is unmet | Read the preflight result; do not register or enable tenant features implicitly. |
| Name already exists | The run ID is reused or a globally unique name collided | Keep existing state intact and choose a new run ID. |
| Expected state is delayed | The service is converging asynchronously | Repeat only the read-only query with bounded retries; do not duplicate creation. |
| Permission denied | Role, Graph scope, or data-plane authorization is insufficient | Confirm the declared least-privilege boundary; do not broaden access automatically. |
| Cleanup refuses ownership | ID, context, or tags differ from the manifest | Investigate the mismatch; never bypass ownership verification. |

## Cleanup and residual verification

Preview exact targets first, execute only after ownership review, then validate post-cleanup:

```powershell
./scripts/cli/Cleanup.ps1 -RunId 'az104l22-01'
./scripts/cli/Cleanup.ps1 -RunId 'az104l22-01' -Execute
./scripts/cli/Validate.ps1 -RunId 'az104l22-01' -Mode PostCleanup
$wrongDestination = az monitor diagnostic-settings show --name "diag-$RunId" --resource $storageId --query workspaceId --output tsv
if ($wrongDestination -ne $workspaceResourceId) { throw 'Diagnostic data is routed to an unexpected workspace.' }
```

`cleanup.json` passes only when no active manifest-managed object remains. Soft-deleted or intentionally retained items must be listed with their reason and expected disposition. The lifecycle never performs irreversible purge automatically.

## Exam debrief and assessment

Explain why the expected state, negative check, and cleanup boundary matter—not only which command was used. Map any missed concept back to its task anchor before reviewing the answer key.

Complete [QUESTIONS.md](assessment/QUESTIONS.md), then use [ANSWERS.md](assessment/ANSWERS.md) for option-by-option remediation. Scores of 85–100% indicate mastery, 70–84% indicate targeted review, and below 70% means repeat the mapped tasks.
