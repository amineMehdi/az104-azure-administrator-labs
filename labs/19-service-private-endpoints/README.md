# Lab 19: Compare service endpoints and private endpoints

[Previous: Lab 18](../18-routing-nsg-asg/README.md) · [Catalog](../README.md) · [Next: Lab 20](../20-azure-dns-bastion/README.md)

This self-contained lab uses Azure CLI commands hosted in PowerShell. Complete the guided lane or the automated lane—not both with the same run ID.

## Scenario, role, and outcome

Scenario: You are a network administrator comparing storage service and private endpoints. Build and prove this disposable service path: The storage account denies public access while a blob private endpoint receives an IP from the private subnet; its zone group writes records into the linked private DNS zone so VNet clients resolve the private service path.

Learner role: A network administrator comparing Storage service and private endpoints.

Outcome: Use Azure CLI in PowerShell to create a locked-down storage service and endpoint subnet, create the blob private endpoint and dns zone group, and reconcile endpoint approval, dns records, and network policy, with recoverable state and deterministic cleanup.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Duration | 120 minutes |
| Difficulty | applied |
| Cost class | `moderate` |
| Command surface | Azure CLI (`az`, `az rest`, Bicep, AzCopy, or KQL where required) hosted in PowerShell |
| Live state | Not executed during this offline rebuild |

Completion criteria:

- All required checkpoints report pass.
- The deterministic break/fix is injected, diagnosed, and repaired.
- cleanup.json reports no active run-owned resources, with any retained item explicitly documented.

## Objectives and checkpoints

| Objective | Skill | Checkpoints |
|---|---|---|
| `ST-ACCESS-01` | Configure Azure Storage firewalls and virtual networks | `LAB19-CP01`, `LAB19-CP05` |
| `CP-APP-07` | Configure networking settings for an App Service | `LAB19-CP02`, `LAB19-CP05` |
| `NW-SECURE-04` | Configure service endpoints for Azure platform as a service (PaaS) | `LAB19-CP03`, `LAB19-CP05` |
| `NW-SECURE-05` | Configure private endpoints for Azure PaaS | `LAB19-CP04`, `LAB19-CP05` |

The authoritative objective wording comes from the [Microsoft AZ-104 study guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/az-104), skills measured as of 2026-04-17.

## Architecture and service topology

![Lab 19 service topology](diagrams/architecture.svg)

The editable source is [architecture.mmd](diagrams/architecture.mmd). The storage account denies public access while a blob private endpoint receives an IP from the private subnet; its zone group writes records into the linked private DNS zone so VNet clients resolve the private service path.

## Concept primer and design decisions

A service endpoint authorizes a subnet to the public service endpoint. A private endpoint creates a NIC with a private IP. Private DNS must map the normal service name to that private IP for clients inside linked VNets.

Design decisions:

- Use separate subnets for comparison.
- Default-deny the storage firewall before adding network authorization.
- Use a DNS zone group to keep endpoint records synchronized.

## Required and optional inputs

| Input | Required | Source | Safe example | Gate behavior |
|---|:---:|---|---|---|
| `run-id` — Unique lowercase run ownership identifier | Yes | parameter | `az104l19-01` | `block` |
| `subscription-id` — Expected disposable subscription ID | Yes | parameter-or-environment (`AZ104_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`) | `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` | `block` |
| `location` — Approved primary Azure region | Yes | parameter-or-environment (`AZ104_LOCATION`) | `westeurope` | `block` |

Secrets stay in temporary environment variables and are never written to `run.json`, validation evidence, or Git. A `skip-checkpoint` gate produces a visible partial result; it never becomes a pass.

## Read-only preflight

Sign in deliberately, inspect the active context, then run the lab preflight. It never signs in, changes context, installs an extension, registers a provider, or creates a resource.

```powershell
az login
az account show --query '{cloud:environmentName,subscription:id,tenant:tenantId,user:user.name}' --output json
./scripts/cli/Preflight.ps1 -SubscriptionId $env:AZ104_SUBSCRIPTION_ID -RunId 'az104l19-01' -Location 'westeurope'
```

Representative redacted output:

```text
context                 True  cloud=AzureCloud; tenant=<redacted>; subscription=<redacted>
azure-cli               True  2.88.x
provider:<namespace>    True  Registered
region                  True  westeurope
Preflight passed. It performed no Azure mutation.
```

If a required row fails, stop. Correct the local tool, context, provider, quota, SKU, region, permission, or input outside the lab, then rerun preflight.

## Task 1 — Verify private-link and private-DNS regional support {#task-1}

Checkpoint: `LAB19-CP01`

Purpose and operational relevance: Read the provider, region, SKU, feature, quota, and companion-tool signals needed for verify private-link and private-dns regional support, without changing Azure state. The change is unsafe when a wrong group ID or unsupported service subresource leaves a private-endpoint connection rejected. This checkpoint therefore proves: The storage private-link resource exposes the blob group ID and the selected region accepts private endpoints.

Run these commands from PowerShell. If you already used the automated lane, choose a new run ID before trying this guided lane.

```powershell
az provider show --namespace Microsoft.Network --query registrationState --output tsv
az provider show --namespace Microsoft.Storage --query registrationState --output tsv
```

Expected state: The storage private-link resource exposes the blob group ID and the selected region accepts private endpoints.

Representative redacted output:

```text
The storage private-link resource exposes the blob group ID and the selected region accepts private endpoints.
```

Positive validation:

```powershell
$network = az provider show --namespace Microsoft.Network --query registrationState --output tsv
if ($network -ne 'Registered') { throw 'Microsoft.Network is not registered.' }
```

Expected positive result: The storage private-link resource exposes the blob group ID and the selected region accepts private endpoints.

Negative validation:

```powershell
$storageProvider = az provider show --namespace Microsoft.Storage --query registrationState --output tsv
if ($storageProvider -ne 'Registered') { throw 'Microsoft.Storage is not registered.' }
```

Expected negative result: LAB19-CP01 negative boundary: The undesired state is absent; the negative assertion must not report: Microsoft.Storage is not registered.

Evidence to retain:

- LAB19-CP01 UTC result for verify private-link and private-dns regional support.
- Exact run-owned resource/object ID returned by the commands in LAB19-CP01.
- Positive assertion proving: The storage private-link resource exposes the blob group ID and the selected region accepts private endpoints.
- Negative assertion proving absence of: Microsoft.Storage is not registered.

Common failure and safe retry: A wrong group ID or unsupported service subresource leaves a private-endpoint connection rejected. Retry LAB19-CP01 for verify private-link and private-dns regional support only after its exact recorded ID and current property are read. If the ID exists, reissue only the idempotent update; if it is absent, repeat only the owning create command, then rerun both assertions.

Cleanup dependency: After LAB19-CP02, LAB19-CP03, LAB19-CP04, LAB19-CP05, remove the exact manifest IDs created or configured by LAB19-CP01 for verify private-link and private-dns regional support; its residual probe must then return zero active IDs.

## Task 2 — Create a locked-down storage service and endpoint subnet {#task-2}

Checkpoint: `LAB19-CP02`

Purpose and operational relevance: Provision and immediately inventory the exact run-owned resources needed to create a locked-down storage service and endpoint subnet, so partial completion remains recoverable. The change is unsafe when disabling public access before private DNS is ready can make all data-plane tests appear broken. This checkpoint therefore proves: The storage account denies public network access and the endpoint subnet has private-endpoint policies configured for the design.

Run these commands from PowerShell. If you already used the automated lane, choose a new run ID before trying this guided lane.

```powershell
$vnet = "vnet-$suffix"; $storage = "st19$suffix"; $endpoint = "pe-$suffix"; $zone = "privatelink.blob.core.windows.net"
az network vnet create --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --name $vnet --address-prefixes 10.19.0.0/16 --subnet-name service --subnet-prefixes 10.19.1.0/24 --output none
az network vnet subnet update --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --vnet-name $vnet --name service --service-endpoints Microsoft.Storage --output none
az network vnet subnet create --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --vnet-name $vnet --name private --address-prefixes 10.19.2.0/24 --disable-private-endpoint-network-policies true --output none
az storage account create --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --name $storage --location $Location --sku Standard_LRS --kind StorageV2 --https-only true --allow-blob-public-access false --output none
$serviceSubnetId = az network vnet subnet show --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --vnet-name $vnet --name service --query id --output tsv
az storage account network-rule add --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --account-name $storage --subnet $serviceSubnetId --output none
az storage account update --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --name $storage --default-action Deny --output none
$storageId = az storage account show --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --name $storage --query id --output tsv
az network private-endpoint create --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --name $endpoint --location $Location --vnet-name $vnet --subnet private --private-connection-resource-id $storageId --group-id blob --connection-name "conn-$suffix" --output none
az network private-dns zone create --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --name $zone --output none
az network private-dns link vnet create --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --zone-name $zone --name "link-$suffix" --virtual-network $vnet --registration-enabled false --output none
```

Expected state: The storage account denies public network access and the endpoint subnet has private-endpoint policies configured for the design.

Representative redacted output:

```text
The storage account denies public network access and the endpoint subnet has private-endpoint policies configured for the design.
```

Positive validation:

```powershell
$serviceEndpoint = az network vnet subnet show --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --vnet-name $vnet --name service --query "serviceEndpoints[?service=='Microsoft.Storage'] | length(@)" --output tsv
if ([int]$serviceEndpoint -ne 1) { throw 'The Storage service endpoint is absent.' }
```

Expected positive result: The storage account denies public network access and the endpoint subnet has private-endpoint policies configured for the design.

Negative validation:

```powershell
$defaultAction = az storage account show --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --name $storage --query networkRuleSet.defaultAction --output tsv
if ($defaultAction -ne 'Deny') { throw "Storage default network action is $defaultAction." }
```

Expected negative result: LAB19-CP02 negative boundary: The undesired state is absent; the negative assertion must not report: Storage default network action is reported defaultAction.

Evidence to retain:

- LAB19-CP02 UTC result for create a locked-down storage service and endpoint subnet.
- Exact run-owned resource/object ID returned by the commands in LAB19-CP02.
- Positive assertion proving: The storage account denies public network access and the endpoint subnet has private-endpoint policies configured for the design.
- Negative assertion proving absence of: Storage default network action is reported defaultAction.

Common failure and safe retry: Disabling public access before private DNS is ready can make all data-plane tests appear broken. Retry LAB19-CP02 for create a locked-down storage service and endpoint subnet only after its exact recorded ID and current property are read. If the ID exists, reissue only the idempotent update; if it is absent, repeat only the owning create command, then rerun both assertions.

Cleanup dependency: After LAB19-CP03, LAB19-CP04, LAB19-CP05, remove the exact manifest IDs created or configured by LAB19-CP02 for create a locked-down storage service and endpoint subnet; its residual probe must then return zero active IDs.

## Task 3 — Create the blob private endpoint and DNS zone group {#task-3}

Checkpoint: `LAB19-CP03`

Purpose and operational relevance: Configure and independently inspect the control-plane and data-path properties needed to create the blob private endpoint and dns zone group. The change is unsafe when a missing VNet link or zone-group association creates a private IP without working name resolution. This checkpoint therefore proves: The private endpoint connection is Approved and its zone group links privatelink.blob.core.windows.net to the VNet.

Run these commands from PowerShell. If you already used the automated lane, choose a new run ID before trying this guided lane.

```powershell
az network private-endpoint dns-zone-group create --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --endpoint-name $endpoint --name default --private-dns-zone $zone --zone-name blob --output none
```

Expected state: The private endpoint connection is Approved and its zone group links privatelink.blob.core.windows.net to the VNet.

Representative redacted output:

```text
The private endpoint connection is Approved and its zone group links privatelink.blob.core.windows.net to the VNet.
```

Positive validation:

```powershell
$connection = az network private-endpoint show --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --name $endpoint --query "privateLinkServiceConnections[0].privateLinkServiceConnectionState.status" --output tsv
if ($connection -ne 'Approved') { throw "Private endpoint connection is $connection." }
```

Expected positive result: The private endpoint connection is Approved and its zone group links privatelink.blob.core.windows.net to the VNet.

Negative validation:

```powershell
$policies = az network vnet subnet show --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --vnet-name $vnet --name private --query privateEndpointNetworkPolicies --output tsv
if ($policies -notin @('Disabled','NetworkSecurityGroupEnabled','RouteTableEnabled')) { throw "Unexpected private endpoint policy state: $policies" }
```

Expected negative result: LAB19-CP03 negative boundary: The undesired state is absent; the negative assertion must not report: Unexpected private endpoint policy state: reported policies.

Evidence to retain:

- LAB19-CP03 UTC result for create the blob private endpoint and dns zone group.
- Exact run-owned resource/object ID returned by the commands in LAB19-CP03.
- Positive assertion proving: The private endpoint connection is Approved and its zone group links privatelink.blob.core.windows.net to the VNet.
- Negative assertion proving absence of: Unexpected private endpoint policy state: reported policies.

Common failure and safe retry: A missing VNet link or zone-group association creates a private IP without working name resolution. Retry LAB19-CP03 for create the blob private endpoint and dns zone group only after its exact recorded ID and current property are read. If the ID exists, reissue only the idempotent update; if it is absent, repeat only the owning create command, then rerun both assertions.

Cleanup dependency: After LAB19-CP04, LAB19-CP05, remove the exact manifest IDs created or configured by LAB19-CP03 for create the blob private endpoint and dns zone group; its residual probe must then return zero active IDs.

## Task 4 — Prove private DNS integration and public denial {#task-4}

Checkpoint: `LAB19-CP04`

Purpose and operational relevance: Exercise the deterministic operational or denied path needed to prove private dns integration and public denial, then retain comparable before-and-after results. The change is unsafe when testing DNS only from the administrator workstation does not prove resolution inside the linked VNet. This checkpoint therefore proves: The endpoint NIC owns a private address, private DNS records reference it, and the public-network property remains Disabled.

Run these commands from PowerShell. If you already used the automated lane, choose a new run ID before trying this guided lane.

```powershell
az network private-endpoint dns-zone-group list --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --endpoint-name $endpoint --output json
az network private-dns record-set a list --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --zone-name $zone --output table
```

Expected state: The endpoint NIC owns a private address, private DNS records reference it, and the public-network property remains Disabled.

Representative redacted output:

```text
The endpoint NIC owns a private address, private DNS records reference it, and the public-network property remains Disabled.
```

Positive validation:

```powershell
$zoneGroups = az network private-endpoint dns-zone-group list --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --endpoint-name $endpoint --query "length(@)" --output tsv
if ([int]$zoneGroups -ne 1) { throw "Expected one DNS zone group; found $zoneGroups." }
```

Expected positive result: The endpoint NIC owns a private address, private DNS records reference it, and the public-network property remains Disabled.

Negative validation:

```powershell
$links = az network private-dns link vnet list --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --zone-name $zone --query "[?virtualNetwork.id!=null] | length(@)" --output tsv
if ([int]$links -ne 1) { throw "Expected one VNet link; found $links." }
```

Expected negative result: LAB19-CP04 negative boundary: The undesired state is absent; the negative assertion must not report: Expected one VNet link; found reported links.

Evidence to retain:

- LAB19-CP04 UTC result for prove private dns integration and public denial.
- Exact run-owned resource/object ID returned by the commands in LAB19-CP04.
- Positive assertion proving: The endpoint NIC owns a private address, private DNS records reference it, and the public-network property remains Disabled.
- Negative assertion proving absence of: Expected one VNet link; found reported links.

Common failure and safe retry: Testing DNS only from the administrator workstation does not prove resolution inside the linked VNet. Retry LAB19-CP04 for prove private dns integration and public denial only after its exact recorded ID and current property are read. If the ID exists, reissue only the idempotent update; if it is absent, repeat only the owning create command, then rerun both assertions.

Cleanup dependency: After LAB19-CP05, remove the exact manifest IDs created or configured by LAB19-CP04 for prove private dns integration and public denial; its residual probe must then return zero active IDs.

## Task 5 — Reconcile endpoint approval, DNS records, and network policy {#task-5}

Checkpoint: `LAB19-CP05`

Purpose and operational relevance: Reconcile live service properties, returned IDs, and dependency-aware removal needed to reconcile endpoint approval, dns records, and network policy before handoff. The change is unsafe when an Approved connection alone can conceal a missing DNS record that sends clients to the public endpoint. This checkpoint therefore proves: Connection status, endpoint IP, zone link, record set, and storage publicNetworkAccess jointly prove the private service path.

Run these commands from PowerShell. If you already used the automated lane, choose a new run ID before trying this guided lane.

```powershell
az network private-endpoint show --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --name $endpoint --query "{state:provisioningState,connection:privateLinkServiceConnections[0].privateLinkServiceConnectionState.status,nic:networkInterfaces[0].id}" --output json
```

Expected state: Connection status, endpoint IP, zone link, record set, and storage publicNetworkAccess jointly prove the private service path.

Representative redacted output:

```text
Connection status, endpoint IP, zone link, record set, and storage publicNetworkAccess jointly prove the private service path.
```

Positive validation:

```powershell
$records = az network private-dns record-set a list --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --zone-name $zone --query "length(@)" --output tsv
if ([int]$records -lt 1) { throw 'The private DNS A record is absent.' }
```

Expected positive result: Connection status, endpoint IP, zone link, record set, and storage publicNetworkAccess jointly prove the private service path.

Negative validation:

```powershell
$publicAccess = az storage account show --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --name $storage --query publicNetworkAccess --output tsv
if ($publicAccess -eq 'Disabled') { return }
$defaultAction = az storage account show --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --name $storage --query networkRuleSet.defaultAction --output tsv
if ($defaultAction -ne 'Deny') { throw 'The storage public network boundary is permissive.' }
```

Expected negative result: LAB19-CP05 negative boundary: The undesired state is absent; the negative assertion must not report: The storage public network boundary is permissive.

Evidence to retain:

- LAB19-CP05 UTC result for reconcile endpoint approval, dns records, and network policy.
- Exact run-owned resource/object ID returned by the commands in LAB19-CP05.
- Positive assertion proving: Connection status, endpoint IP, zone link, record set, and storage publicNetworkAccess jointly prove the private service path.
- Negative assertion proving absence of: The storage public network boundary is permissive.

Common failure and safe retry: An Approved connection alone can conceal a missing DNS record that sends clients to the public endpoint. Retry LAB19-CP05 for reconcile endpoint approval, dns records, and network policy only after its exact recorded ID and current property are read. If the ID exists, reissue only the idempotent update; if it is absent, repeat only the owning create command, then rerun both assertions.

Cleanup dependency: After all service validation and evidence capture, remove the exact manifest IDs created or configured by LAB19-CP05 for reconcile endpoint approval, dns records, and network policy; its residual probe must then return zero active IDs.

## Final validation and result interpretation

Run independent deployment validation after all required checkpoints:

```powershell
./scripts/cli/Validate.ps1 -RunId 'az104l19-01' -Mode Deployment
az resource list --resource-group 'rg-az104-l19-az104l19-01' --query '[].{name:name,type:type}' --output table
```

- `pass`: every required positive and negative check passed.
- `partial`: every required check passed, but at least one optional gate was deliberately skipped.
- `fail`: a required checkpoint failed; do not record the lab as complete.

Keep the redacted `validation.json`; do not retain credentials, tokens, access keys, certificate material, email addresses, tenant IDs, or unredacted command output.

## Deterministic break/fix exercise

Injection: Remove the private DNS VNet link while leaving the endpoint connected.

Inject the bounded fault:

```powershell
az network private-dns link vnet delete --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --zone-name $zone --name "link-$suffix" --yes
```

Capture the failed state with a read-only query:

```powershell
az network private-endpoint dns-zone-group list --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --endpoint-name $endpoint --output table
az network private-dns link vnet list --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --zone-name $zone --output table
```

Repair only the injected setting, then repeat the same query:

```powershell
az network private-dns link vnet create --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --zone-name $zone --name "link-$suffix" --virtual-network $vnet --registration-enabled false --output none
az network private-dns link vnet show --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --zone-name $zone --name "link-$suffix" --query virtualNetworkLinkState --output tsv
```

Expected symptom: Clients resolve the public address and private-path validation fails.

Diagnose with a read-only service query:

```powershell
az network private-endpoint dns-zone-group list --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --endpoint-name $endpoint --output table
az network private-dns link vnet list --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --zone-name $zone --output table
```

Diagnosis: Inspect the zone group, A record, link, and client DNS result.

Repair: Restore the recorded VNet link and verify private resolution.

Before/after evidence must show the failed negative or positive check before repair and the same check passing afterward. Do not inject a second fault until the first is removed.

## Optional job-style challenge

Recommend service endpoint or private endpoint for three security and cost scenarios.

Deliver a short change record containing assumptions, exact commands, redacted evidence, cost and risk notes, rollback, and residual results. The challenge is optional and never changes required checkpoint status.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Safe next step |
|---|---|---|
| Context mismatch | Active CLI context differs from `run.json` | Stop, inspect `az account show`, and select the intended disposable context yourself. |
| Provider or feature unavailable | Registration, region, feature, or SKU gate is unmet | Read the preflight result; do not register or enable tenant features implicitly. |
| Name already exists | The run ID is reused or a globally unique name collided | Keep existing state intact and choose a new run ID. |
| Expected state is delayed | The service is converging asynchronously | Repeat only the read-only query with bounded retries; do not duplicate creation. |
| Permission denied | Role, Graph scope, or data-plane authorization is insufficient | Confirm the declared least-privilege boundary; do not broaden access automatically. |
| Cleanup refuses ownership | ID, context, or tags differ from the manifest | Investigate the mismatch; never bypass ownership verification. |

## Cleanup and residual verification

Preview exact targets first, execute only after ownership review, then validate post-cleanup:

```powershell
./scripts/cli/Cleanup.ps1 -RunId 'az104l19-01'
./scripts/cli/Cleanup.ps1 -RunId 'az104l19-01' -Execute
./scripts/cli/Validate.ps1 -RunId 'az104l19-01' -Mode PostCleanup
$publicAccess = az storage account show --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --name $storage --query publicNetworkAccess --output tsv
if ($publicAccess -eq 'Disabled') { return }
$defaultAction = az storage account show --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --name $storage --query networkRuleSet.defaultAction --output tsv
if ($defaultAction -ne 'Deny') { throw 'The storage public network boundary is permissive.' }
```

`cleanup.json` passes only when no active manifest-managed object remains. Soft-deleted or intentionally retained items must be listed with their reason and expected disposition. The lifecycle never performs irreversible purge automatically.

## Exam debrief and assessment

Explain why the expected state, negative check, and cleanup boundary matter—not only which command was used. Map any missed concept back to its task anchor before reviewing the answer key.

Complete [QUESTIONS.md](assessment/QUESTIONS.md), then use [ANSWERS.md](assessment/ANSWERS.md) for option-by-option remediation. Scores of 85–100% indicate mastery, 70–84% indicate targeted review, and below 70% means repeat the mapped tasks.
